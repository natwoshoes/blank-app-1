The idea is that the earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow. You can invest in things like stocks, bonds, or special retirement accounts (like a Roth IRA or 401(k)), and over time, your investments can earn interest or increase in value. The goal is to have a bigger nest egg by the time you retire, so you don't have to rely on just Social Security or your savings.
