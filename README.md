## Inspiration
Financial literacy is a critical life skill that often goes untaught, particularly affecting first-generation and low-income students who may lack access to financial mentorship or resources. Many students enter college and the workforce without understanding basic financial concepts, making it difficult to make informed decisions about student loans, budgeting, and long-term financial planning. This gap in knowledge can have long-lasting impacts on their financial well-being and future opportunities.

## What it does
Cash Course is an interactive educational platform that explains financial concepts for students who may not have easy access to financial literacy resources. Our platform features:
- Interactive modules covering essential topics like student aid, credit management, and retirement planning
- An AI-powered chatbot that answers financial questions in plain language
- Curated resources and practical guides for real-world financial decisions

## How we built it
We developed Cash Course using a modern tech stack focused on accessibility and user experience:
- Streamlit framework for the main web application interface
- Python for backend logic and data processing
- CSS for styling
- Gemini API integration for our interactive chatbot
- Git for version control and team collaboration

## Challenges we ran into
Our team faced several learning curves during development:
- First-time experience working with external APIs, particularly in implementing the Gemini-powered chatbot
- Learning to use Streamlit's framework and its unique approach to web development
- Coordinating version control with Git for team members who were new to collaborative development
- Balancing technical complexity with user accessibility in our explanations of financial concepts
  
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Implemented an AI chatbot that provides personalized financial guidance
Built a platform that can make a meaningful impact on students' financial literacy

## What we learned

possibly developing a mobile version of cash course for better accessibility
